Intro with some funny story about a date with CFD chick

Mass conservation

Explain divergence, with vector spaces, accelarating field and decelarating fields

Compressible case, 1D is intuitive, 2D is highly non intuitive.
But what does the rho say, we have already established divergence less than zero is compressible so it must be related to that sense somehow, but how?

Chain rule, explain grad rho and dot product

Example with earth kind of scenario?



To understand divergence better, let's become engineers and assume density is constant!
